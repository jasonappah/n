# Notes

Hi! This site holds my notes and an API endpoint to convert Notion docs to PDFs. Check it out at [https://n.jasonaa.me](https://n.jasonaa.me) and [https://n.jasonaa.me/print](https://n.jasonaa.me/print). This repo is mostly a clone of [this awesome starter kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit).

Originally I hosted this on Vercel but I had some trouble with Puppeteer, so for now it's running in a Docker container on a Linode VPS. Eventually I'd like to get it back on Vercel.
